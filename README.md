# Hydro
Simple script to pull hydrological data from weather.gov and send out flood warnings.

Ideally one would want to put this on a cron job to run as often as desired. For my personal use case, I have a raspberry pi 3 set up which runs this script every two days. To automate this on windows, you can use the task scheduler.
